INSTALLING COMPILE-TIME DEPENDENCIES -- WINDOWS

Windows users will need to visit the appropriate web sites and download and
install the relevant binaries for Ant, CMake, Subversion, and the Java runtime.

The easiest way to install the Boost Thread library on Windows is to use the
free installer from BoostPro:

  http://www.boostpro.com/products/free

When running the installer:

  * Under "Compilers," check the version of Visual C++ matching your system.
  * Under "Variants," check all eight boxes.
  * When choosing components, check "Boost DateTime" and "Boost Thread."
